description : DNS-BH - Malware Domain Blacklist. A list of domains that are known to be used to propagate malware are listed in Bind and Windows zone files. The domains are loaded onto an internal DNS server. When a computer requests a URL or file from one of these domains, a fake reply is sent, thus preventing many malware installs from occuring.
