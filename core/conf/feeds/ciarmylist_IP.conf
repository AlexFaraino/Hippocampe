description : The CI Army list is a subset of the CINS Active Threat Intelligence ruleset, and consists of IP addresses that meet two basic criteria: 1) The IP's recent Rogue Packet score factor is very poor, and 2) The InfoSec community has not yet identified the IP as malicious. We think this second factor is important: We don't want to waste peoples' time listing thousands of IPs that have already been placed on other reputation lists; our list is meant to supplement and enhance the InfoSec community's existing efforts by providing IPs that haven't been identified yet.
